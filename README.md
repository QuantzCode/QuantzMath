## Reason
Many people just watch vids on Youtube saying complete Ruby in 2 hours and they learn it. Only to realize their foundation is weak and fragile
If you take these brain stretching exercises your foundation will be strong and you won't have to relearn the language when a new feature is out!

Mathematics is one of the best ways to learn how to code and more, simply use our code as references.
Currently we are trying Python 3 and Java, soon we will try other languages.
